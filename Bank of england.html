        <center><b><h2><u>The Bank of England believes that up to 75,000 jobs could be lost within the financial services industry because of Brexit. </u></h2></b></center>
        <p>Citing senior figures, the broadcaster reported that the Bank was using the 75,000 number as a “reasonable scenario”, based on a situation under which no specific financial services deal is struck between the UK and the EU.</p>
        <p>A Reuters survey of firms employing the bulk of workers in international finance showed last month that around 10,000 finance jobs would likely be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the UK is denied access to Europe’s single market.</p>
        <p>Frankfurt is largely seen as the most popular destination, with Paris, Dublin, Brussels and Madrid other contenders.</p>
        <p>The EU could also impose other "locations specific" regulations such as where trading in trillions of pounds worth of euro-denominated financial insurance products has to be based.</p>
        <p>That could mean trading jobs moving to Paris or Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>There have been a number of studies on the potential employment impact of Brexit.</p>
        <p>A poll of more than 100 finance firms by Reuters suggested the number of job losses would be just below 10,000 in the "few years" following Brexit.</p>
        <p>I understand the bank believes the 10,000 jobs figure is likely on "day one" of Brexit if there is no deal.</p>
        <p>The Brussels-based think tank, Bruegel, said that over time 30,000 jobs could move to the continent or be lost as London's financial sector shrinks.</p>
        <center><h3>Modest moves</h3></center>
        <p>Many also believe there will be a positive outcome to the EU negotiations as the City supports many governments and businesses on the continent in raising funds and executing global deals.</p>
        <p>Those companies and firms would want to keep a close relationship with the UK and its well-developed global markets capacity.</p>
        <p>Before the referendum, many banks suggested that they may move thousands of jobs.</p>
        <p>But since then announcements have been more modest.</p>
        <p>JP Morgan said it might have to move 4,000 jobs, but since the referendum has cut that number to around 1,000.</p>
        <p>The Swiss bank, UBS, said it may move as few as 250 jobs after initially planning to relocate as many as 1,000.</p>
        <p>And the chief executive of Barclays, Jess Staley, said that Brexit was no more complicated than setting up a holding company in America, which the bank was obliged to do in 2016.</p>
        <p>More recently Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has tweeted that he will be spending "a lot more time" in Frankfurt despite the American bank building a large new HQ in London.</p>

                        Netflix has pulled the plug on House of Cards, a day after its lead actor Kevin Spacey was accused of sexually harassing a teenage boy.
