        <center><b><h2><u>Netflix has pulled the plug on House of Cards, a day after its lead actor Kevin Spacey was accused of sexually harassing a teenage boy. </u></h2></b></center>
  <p>The media streaming company said it was "deeply troubled" by the allegation, made by the actor Anthony Rapp.</p>
<p>In an interview with Buzzfeed, Rapp alleged Spacey tried to seduce him when he was 14, after a party in 1986.</p>
<p>Spacey said he was "beyond horrified" to hear the story but did not remember the encounter.</p>
<p>Kevin Spacey said he owed Anthony Rapp a "sincere apology" for what he said would have been "deeply inappropriate drunken behavior".</p>
<p>Spacey also announced that he was now living "as a gay man" but the Oscar winning actor has been widely criticized for choosing this moment to come out.
Gay rights activists have said linking his sexuality to an apology over allegations of sexual harassment was harmful to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) community.
In House of Cards, Kevin Spacey plays the ruthless American politician Frank Underwood. The drama has been widely acclaimed and filming is currently on the sixth series.
While Netflix has said it will be the last, several reports have suggested that the producers had decided to end the series well before the allegation emerged.
Media Rights Capital and Netflix, who produce House of Cards, released a statement on Monday in response to the allegations against Spacey, saying they were “deeply troubled” by the news.
“In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Netflix spokesperson confirmed to Guardian Australia that the decision to end the show was made months earlier, and not in response to the allegations about Spacey surfacing.</p>
<p>House of Cards began in 2013, following husband and wife team Frank and Claire Underwood (Spacey and Wright) as they manipulated and murdered their way up the political ladder to the Oval Office. The show was nominated for 33 Emmy awards and eight Golden Globe awards, with Spacey and Wright winning best actor and actress Golden Globes for their performances.</p>
<p>The show received favourable reviews for its first two seasons, but the response to recent seasons has been mixed.</p>
<p>Social media response to the news has resulted in calls for the show to continue but with Wright as the sole lead.</p>
